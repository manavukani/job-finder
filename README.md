# Job Finder

This is an online job scraping and analysis tool that provides the user with the ability to filter jobs based on the userâ€™s interest. This allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs, hence a perfect site to scrap the job details from.

So, leave the tedious and monotonous task of looking up the job postings to our web app that not only provides the jobs posted every day but helps to filter out the results based on your liking.
