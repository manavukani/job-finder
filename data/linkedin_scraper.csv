Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an expansive future for all.

We adopt digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, ambitious steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/3301904929?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Ecisco%2Ecom%2Fjobs%2FProjectDetail%2FSoftware-Engineer-1371900%2F1371900%3Fsource%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=YAXR&refId=Hdw5pdGU%2F2NtnlyUA%2FvFuQ%3D%3D&trackingId=tIdixv0od7z%2FNy6v%2Fmf5qQ%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite,Not Applicable,Full-time,Information Technology,"Computer Hardware Manufacturing, Software Development, and Computer Networking Products","['java', 'python', 'mysql']"

High-impact software development jobs for smart people.

Code that saves lives.

As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 250 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.

The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.

Experience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.

We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Live affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin. Madison, a city surrounded by water, has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

More than just important work.

We offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers.
