    on a day-to-day basis? Here comes JobFinder.
    JobFinder is an online job scraping and analysis tool that provides the user with the ability to filter jobs
    posted on Linkedin based on the users interest. LinkedIn is an employment-oriented online service that is a
    platform primarily used for professional networking and career development. This allows job seekers to post
    their CVs and employers to post jobs, hence a perfect site to scrap the job details from.
    So, leave the tedious and monotonous task of looking up the job postings to our JobFinder that not only
    provides the jobs posted every day but helps to filter out the results based on your liking.
